# React Book App

A React.js application that displays data about books (Title, picture, author, price and description) which is stored in a separate sql database, displays them on the 
application using a separate rest api server. React was used to take advantage of react router to make the application a single page application.

*****app folder******
  contains the application itself 
  

****server folder*****
  contains the rest api, which acts as a server for the data stored in the database.
